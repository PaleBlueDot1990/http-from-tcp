HTTP message format according to RFC 9112:
start-line CRLF              -> request (for request) or response status (for response)
*( field-line CRLF )         -> http headers (key value pairs)
CRLF
[ message-body ]             -> the message body is optional 

We will be assuming that at least one header is present in the message.

HTTP message examples-
GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: localhost:42069\r\n
